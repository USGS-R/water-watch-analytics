## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r test, echo=FALSE}
source('R/water_watch_urls.R')
source('R/plot_helper.R')
library(zeallot)
all_watch_pages <- readRDS('all_pages.rds')
c(df, plot) %<-% analyze_wwatch_urls(path_df = all_watch_pages$all_raw$wwatch, 
                                   nwis_df = all_watch_pages$all_raw$nwis)
plot
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
